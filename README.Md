This monorepo manages two key parts of cryptocraft:
1. ![web3-infra](web3-infra/README.md): a foundry project managing the smart contracts required to mint and burn tokenized items
2. ![server-plugin](server-plugin/README.md): a Minecraft server plugin written in Kotlin for translating user commands into blockchain transactions
